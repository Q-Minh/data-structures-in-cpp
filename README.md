# data-structures-in-cpp
amateur implementations of classic data structures in c++

## lists
### currently implemented data structures are
- singly linked list
- doubly linked list
- circular linked list
### coming up next
- skip list

## queues
### currently implemented
- array based queue
- doubly linked list based queue (deque)
- linked list based priority queue
- extendable array vector based priority queue
- linked list based adaptable priority queue

## stacks
### currently implemented
- array based stack
- deque based stack
- linked list based stack (singly or doubly)

## vector
### currently implemented
- extendable array based vector

## trees
### currently implemented
- node based linked general tree
- vector based binary tree **(failing tests)**
- vector based heap using complete binary tree
- node based linked binary search tree
- avl tree extending node based linked binary tree
### coming up next
- multi-way tree
- red-black tree
- standard trie
- compression trie

## maps
### currently implemented
- hash table with separate chaining collision handling scheme
- dictionary that extends map by allowing duplicate entries
- array based fixed size ordered map (using vector)

## sets
### coming up next
- **to be determined**

## graphs
### coming up next
- node based adjacency list
- array based adjacency matrix
